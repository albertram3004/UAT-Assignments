        Lecture 1 assignment
        // I updated the previews heater <h2> and <h3> and used the right rule required for this assignment which was paragraph <p></p>
        Note: I have no excuses for submitting my assignment late but I just wanted to write the reason here. 
        I moved to a new home and I was organizing my personal stuff and seeting up my home office for my classes.
        Again my apoligize.
        Best
